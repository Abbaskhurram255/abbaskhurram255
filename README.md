### Hello World! 👋




- 🔭 Is currently preoccupied with [AyeshaPT](https://github.com/abbaskhurram255/Chatterbox/), her most favorite project
- 🌱 Is also busy learning React
- 👯 Is willing to collaborate on an amazing Progressive Web Application (PWA)
- 🤔 Is also looking for someone to help her improve her React
- 💬 Ask me anything about frontend development... wait, nah, just kidding. Tbh I'm still having trouble with aforelisted frontend languages :P.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact 01: I've been coding since I was 13, and back then I used no languages other than vanilla JavaScript to create <em>single-page applications</em>
- ⚡ Fun fact 02: Uses FL Studio v20.8.3 as her favorite Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). As a matter of fact, all the background music she's used in her AyeshaPT sub-games was created via FL Studio, her most favorite DAW. [You may find her music on Spotify here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6QUns8NUaRZU7grd3Rz4EV)
