- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vue, and Angular
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an amazing, responsive project
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Vue, and Angular
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me anything about frontend development... lol just kidding. I'm still having trouble with aforelisted (frontend) languages, to be honest
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
